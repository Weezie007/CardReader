This library will allow you to read iClass DH cards with a multiClass HID Card Reader using Clock and Data Protocol.

As Surya and I get different types of cards, we will add functionality to the library. Aslo, when we get a Wiegand Protocol Card Reader, we will also add that.

You'll see in the example file there is a wrapper function for attachInterrupt() in the setup function. We will work on integrating this into the library so the user doesn't have to worry about it.
