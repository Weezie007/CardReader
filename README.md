This library will allow you to read iClass DH cards with a multiClass HID Card Reader using Clock and Data Protocol.

The Library is still being developed. 

The .ino file will read the card on its own. To run the file, you will need to remove the .h and .cpp files from the .ino folder. Otherwise, Arduino will try to run the .h and .cpp files. 

The .h and .cpp files will be soon released as their own library.
